# JASP for Audit (JfA)

JASP for Audit **(JfA)** is an officially supported add-on module for JASP (www.jasp-stats.org) that is developed for statistical auditing. The module includes procedures and analyses that can be used in daily auditing tasks and eliminates the difficulties that arise from programming statistical analyses and correctly interpreting their results. The module provides a guided workflow for performing a full (Classical or Bayesian) audit. It also features methods for planning an audit without data and evaluating an audit using a sample list only.

**Note: The required version of JASP (0.9.3) is not released yet, which means that the dynamic module functionality is not supported.**
